1)  Create a greet function that takes two parameters - a first name and last name.  Return a greeting
	to the user and concatonate the first and last names.

	Example:  If I call the function and pass the arguments 'John' and 'Smith' it should
			  return "Hello, John Smith"


2)  Create a function that checks if a user's password is correct. If the password passed as the argument is
	"alpaca49" log a message to the console telling the user it's correct. Otherwise, tell the user that the
	password is incorrect.

3)  Create a function that checks if a username and password are correct. The function should take two strings
	as arguments - the first is a username, and the second is a password.  If the username is "Russell Wilson"
	and the password is "qb4lyf", log a message to the console saying "You may enter." If the username or
	password are different, log a message to the console saying "username or password is incorrect."


4)  Create a function that logs numbers 5-10. This function should take no parameters.


5) Create a function that takes an array as an argument. Return the zeroth item in the array.

	Example: If I call the function and pass [5, 3, 7] as an argument, it should return the zeroth item.


6) Create a function that takes an array as an argument. Return the length of the array.

	Example: If I call the function and pass [54, 2, 65] as an argument, it should return 3.


7) Create a function that takes an array as an argument and logs each value in the array to the console.

	Example: If I call the function and pass [23, 7, 12, 1], it should log:
			23
			7
			12
			1

8)  Create a function that takes a number as an argument and checks whether the number is divisible by 3.
	If it is, return true. Otherwise, return false.


9) Create a function that takes an array of numbers. Return the lowest value.
