Intro to Git


// Check if you have git

1) First let's verify that you have git installed. In terminal, type the following:

   git --version


   This will tell you that you have git and what version you have. If you get no response when you type this, you do not thave git installed.


// Configuring global variables

2) Set your username and email address.  The first line will set your username and the second will set your email address.

git config --global user.name "Farhad K. Ahmed" 
git conifg --global user.email "farhadahmed2007@gmail.com"


// Create a git repository

3) There are two ways to create a git repository.

	a) Create a folder for your project. Navigate into that folder and type the following to initialize  a git repository:

	
	git init


	b) Navigate to the directory you want to create the folder for your project within.  The following line will create a new directory and also initialize it as a git repository. This line contains the keywords "git" and "init" followed by the name of the folder.

	
	git init some-directory-name 



// Commonly used git commands

git add . - places all changes made to the staging area and lets git know to track these changes
git add [filename] - places changes made to the specified file in the staging area a
git commit -m "some message" - once changes have been added to staging, use this to record changes to the repository

git status - describes the current status of your repo (i.e., whether changes need to be committed or added to staging)

git log - shows a history of commits. 

git branch foo-bar -- creates a branch called foo-bar
or
git checkout -b foo-bar -- creates a branch called foo-bar and switches to that branch


git checkout some-branch -- checks out a branch of this name.
